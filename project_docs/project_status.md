# Thesis Grey Project Status

## Current Status

As of the latest update, the Thesis Grey project has been successfully implemented with Wasp v0.16.0 and follows the principles of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). 

- **Task 2 (Implement Authentication System) is complete**: Uses standard `usernameAndPassword` method, default 'Researcher' role on signup, login/logout, profile page, and protected routes. 
- **Task 3 (Develop Search Strategy Builder) is in progress**: Basic search session creation and listing are implemented. Session detail page structure is created.

## Core Architecture

The project follows a feature-first organization, with the following structure:

```
src/client/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                # Authentication features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ searchStrategy/      # Search strategy builder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ serpExecution/       # Search execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resultsManager/      # Results management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reviewResults/       # Review interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reporting/           # Reporting components
```

Each feature directory contains a consistent internal structure:

```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/           # Page components that correspond to routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # UI components specific to this feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/           # Custom React hooks for this feature
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Utility functions specific to this feature
```

## Implemented Features

### Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Wasp v0.16.0 configuration with route and page definitions
- ‚úÖ Entity models defined in schema.prisma
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database integration
- ‚úÖ Authentication system with username/password
- ‚úÖ Basic routing and page structure

### Feature Implementation
- ‚úÖ User authentication and profile management (Task 2 Completed):
  - Signup (Username/Password - Role defaulted to Researcher)
  - Login/Logout
  - Protected Routes (`authRequired: true`)
  - Profile Page (view/edit email if present)
- ‚úÖ Implicit Lead Reviewer role handling (Phase 1):
  - The creator of a `SearchSession` (identified by `SearchSession.userId`) is the implicit Lead Reviewer for that session.
  - Authorization for session-specific actions relies on checking `session.userId === context.user.id`.
  - Global `User.role` ('Researcher'/'Admin') is **not** modified upon session creation.
- üöß Search strategy builder (Task 3 In Progress):
  - Session creation (via `createSearchSession` action).
  - Session listing (via `getSearchSessions` query and `SearchSessionList` component).
  - Session detail page skeleton (via `getSearchSession` query and `SearchSessionDetailPage` component).
- ‚è≥ Search execution via Google Search API (Task 4 Pending)
- ‚è≥ Results processing and management (Task 5 Pending)
- ‚è≥ Review workflow with tagging and notes (Task 6 Pending)
- ‚è≥ Basic reporting functionality (Task 7 Pending)

### UI Components
- ‚úÖ Authentication forms (using standard Wasp components)
- ‚úÖ Search session list (`SearchSessionList`)
- ‚úÖ Search session creation form (integrated into `SearchStrategyPage`)
- ‚úÖ Basic `MainLayout` component
- ‚úÖ Search session detail page skeleton (`SearchSessionDetailPage`)
- ‚úÖ Shadcn UI component library integration
  - Button, Card, Input, and other basic UI components
  - Custom theme using CSS variables
  - Accessibility improvements with Radix UI primitives

## Recent Improvements

### Authentication System Updates
- Reverted authentication to use Wasp's standard `usernameAndPassword` method.
- Simplified signup form to use default Wasp components.
- Removed email verification and password reset flows for Phase 1.
- Implemented `userSignupFields` for handling username and default role assignment.
- Updated database schema (`username` required, `email` optional).
- **Clarified Lead Reviewer Role Handling**: Refactored `createSearchSession` to align with documentation (PRD, auth docs). Phase 1 Lead Reviewer role is implicit based on session ownership (`session.userId`), and the global `User.role` is not modified during session creation.

### Search Strategy Implementation (Task 3)
- Added Wasp definitions (routes, pages, queries, actions) for search strategy.
- Implemented `getSearchSessions` and `createSearchSession` server logic.
- Implemented `getSearchSession` query and basic `SearchSessionDetailPage`.
- Created `SearchSessionList` component.
- Addressed compilation errors related to type inference in Wasp actions.

### SearchSession Query Fixes
- Removed references to Phase 2 fields that aren't defined in the current schema
- Simplified query implementation to match the current data model
- Fixed error handling in server operations

### Component Organization
The project has been reorganized to follow a consistent component organization pattern across all features:
- **Pages** focus on composition and layout
- **Components** encapsulate specific UI functionality
- **Hooks** handle data fetching and state management
- **Utils** provide helper functions

### Code Quality Improvements
- Improved TypeScript integration with the `satisfies` operator for type inference
- Better error handling with Wasp's HttpError
- Cleaner page components through composition

## Pending Tasks for UI Team

### UI Implementation
- Complete the styling and layout of all pages
- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Add loading states and error handling UI
- Enhance user experience with better feedback

### Feature Refinement
- Improve search strategy builder UI
- Enhance results filtering and sorting UI
- Add visualization to reporting section
- Create a more intuitive review interface

### Quality Assurance
- Complete end-to-end testing of all features
- Test boundary cases and error scenarios
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize performance for large result sets

## Next Steps

1. UI team to complete the frontend implementation
2. Implement comprehensive client-side validation
3. Add loading indicators and better error feedback
4. Complete UI testing and optimization
5. Prepare for production deployment
