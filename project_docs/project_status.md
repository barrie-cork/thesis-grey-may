# Thesis Grey Project Status

## Current Status

As of the latest update, the Thesis Grey project has been successfully reorganized following the principles of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). This reorganization enhances code cohesion, improves maintainability, and aligns the project structure with best practices.

## Core Architecture

The project follows a feature-first organization, with the following structure:

```
src/client/
├── auth/                # Authentication features
├── home/                # Homepage and landing pages
├── searchStrategy/      # Search strategy builder
├── serpExecution/       # Search execution
├── resultsManager/      # Results management
├── reviewResults/       # Review interface
├── reporting/           # Reporting components
└── shared/              # Shared components
```

Each feature directory contains a consistent internal structure:

```
feature/
├── pages/           # Page components that correspond to routes
├── components/      # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks for this feature
├── utils/           # Utility functions specific to this feature
└── types.ts         # Type definitions specific to this feature
```

## Recent Improvements

### Component Organization
The project has been reorganized to follow a consistent component organization pattern across all features:
- **Pages** focus on composition and layout
- **Components** encapsulate specific UI functionality
- **Hooks** handle data fetching and state management
- **Utils** provide helper functions
- **Types** define feature-specific type definitions

### Code Quality Improvements
- Improved component separation and organization
- Enhanced type safety with feature-specific type definitions
- Better code reuse through custom hooks
- Cleaner page components through composition

### Documentation Updates
- Updated architecture documentation
- Created component organization guidelines
- Updated coding conventions and rules

## Pending Tasks and Future Work

### Phase 1 Completion
- Complete end-to-end testing of all features
- Finalize error handling and edge cases
- Improve loading states and feedback

### Phase 2 Preparation
The following Phase 2 features have been prepared or partially implemented:
- Extended entity schema with optional Phase 2 fields (roles, organizations, teams)
- Server-side operations made extensible for future team/org filtering
- UI prepared to support future role display
- Phase 2 entities and routes added (commented out) in main.wasp

### Phase 2 Features (Planned)
- Role-based access control
- Team and organization management
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
- Export functionality improvements
