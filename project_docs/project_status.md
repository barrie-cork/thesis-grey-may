# Thesis Grey Project Status

## Current Status

As of the latest update, the Thesis Grey project has been successfully implemented with Wasp v0.16.0 and follows the principles of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). The authentication system has been recently updated to match Wasp v0.16.0's new API requirements, and the application is now running successfully.

## Core Architecture

The project follows a feature-first organization, with the following structure:

```
src/client/
├── auth/                # Authentication features
├── searchStrategy/      # Search strategy builder
├── serpExecution/       # Search execution
├── resultsManager/      # Results management
├── reviewResults/       # Review interface
└── reporting/           # Reporting components
```

Each feature directory contains a consistent internal structure:

```
feature/
├── pages/           # Page components that correspond to routes
├── components/      # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks for this feature
└── utils/           # Utility functions specific to this feature
```
