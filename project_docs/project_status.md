# Thesis Grey Project Status

## Current Status

As of the latest update, the Thesis Grey project has been successfully implemented with Wasp v0.16.0 and follows the principles of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). Task 2 (Implement Authentication System) is now complete using the standard **usernameAndPassword** method. This includes user signup (defaulting to Researcher role), login/logout, and protected routes. Email-specific flows like verification and password reset have been removed for Phase 1 simplicity.

## Core Architecture

The project follows a feature-first organization, with the following structure:

```
src/client/
├── auth/                # Authentication features
├── searchStrategy/      # Search strategy builder
├── serpExecution/       # Search execution
├── resultsManager/      # Results management
├── reviewResults/       # Review interface
└── reporting/           # Reporting components
```

Each feature directory contains a consistent internal structure:

```
feature/
├── pages/           # Page components that correspond to routes
├── components/      # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks for this feature
└── utils/           # Utility functions specific to this feature
```

## Implemented Features

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Wasp v0.16.0 configuration with route and page definitions
- ✅ Entity models defined in schema.prisma
- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration
- ✅ Authentication system with username/password
- ✅ Basic routing and page structure

### Feature Implementation
- ✅ User authentication and profile management (Task 2 Completed):
  - Signup (Username/Password - Role defaulted to Researcher)
  - Login/Logout
  - Protected Routes (`authRequired: true`)
  - Profile Page (view/edit email if present)
- ✅ Implicit Lead Reviewer role assignment on session creation
- ✅ Search strategy builder with session management
- ✅ Search execution via Google Search API
- ✅ Results processing and management
- ✅ Review workflow with tagging and notes
- ✅ Basic reporting functionality

### UI Components
- ✅ Authentication forms (using standard Wasp components)
- ✅ Search session management
- ✅ Results display
- ✅ Tag management interface
- ✅ Report generation controls
- ✅ Shadcn UI component library integration
  - Button, Card, Input, and other basic UI components
  - Custom theme using CSS variables
  - Accessibility improvements with Radix UI primitives

## Recent Improvements

### Authentication System Updates
- Reverted authentication to use Wasp's standard `usernameAndPassword` method.
- Simplified signup form to use default Wasp components.
- Removed email verification and password reset flows for Phase 1.
- Implemented `userSignupFields` for handling username and default role assignment.
- Updated database schema (`username` required, `email` optional).
- Implemented implicit Lead Reviewer role logic upon search session creation.

### SearchSession Query Fixes
- Removed references to Phase 2 fields that aren't defined in the current schema
- Simplified query implementation to match the current data model
- Fixed error handling in server operations

### Component Organization
The project has been reorganized to follow a consistent component organization pattern across all features:
- **Pages** focus on composition and layout
- **Components** encapsulate specific UI functionality
- **Hooks** handle data fetching and state management
- **Utils** provide helper functions

### Code Quality Improvements
- Improved TypeScript integration with the `satisfies` operator for type inference
- Better error handling with Wasp's HttpError
- Cleaner page components through composition

## Pending Tasks for UI Team

### UI Implementation
- Complete the styling and layout of all pages
- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Add loading states and error handling UI
- Enhance user experience with better feedback

### Feature Refinement
- Improve search strategy builder UI
- Enhance results filtering and sorting UI
- Add visualization to reporting section
- Create a more intuitive review interface

### Quality Assurance
- Complete end-to-end testing of all features
- Test boundary cases and error scenarios
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize performance for large result sets

## Next Steps

1. UI team to complete the frontend implementation
2. Implement comprehensive client-side validation
3. Add loading indicators and better error feedback
4. Complete UI testing and optimization
5. Prepare for production deployment
