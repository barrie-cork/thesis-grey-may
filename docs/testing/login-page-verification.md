## Prerequisites

1. The Wasp application is running locally (`wasp start`)
2. A web browser is available for testing
3. Access to the database via Prisma Studio (`wasp db studio`)

## Test Cases

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Verify the following UI elements are present and correctly styled:
   - Card container with proper shadow and rounded corners
   - Title: "Sign in to your account"
   - Description text
   - Username/email input field
   - Password input field with masking
   - Sign in button with proper styling
   - Link to signup page

**Expected Results:**
- All UI elements are visible and properly aligned
- The form is centered on the page
- The card has proper padding and spacing
- Shadcn UI components are properly rendered

### 2. Authentication Error Handling

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter invalid credentials:
   - Username: nonexistent@example.com
   - Password: wrongpassword
3. Click the Sign in button

**Expected Results:**
- An error alert is displayed with appropriate styling (red/destructive variant)
- The error message is descriptive (e.g., "Invalid credentials")
- The form remains usable for another attempt

### 3. Login Functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a test user if none exists:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup
   - Create a user with valid details
   - Logout if automatically logged in
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
3. Enter the valid credentials for the test user
4. Click the Sign in button

**Expected Results:**
- User is successfully authenticated
- Redirect occurs to the application's main page
- No error messages are displayed

### 4. Protected Route Access

**Test Steps:**
1. Logout if currently logged in
2. Try to access a protected route (e.g., http://localhost:3000/profile)
3. Note the redirect to the login page
4. Login with valid credentials
5. Try to access the protected route again

**Expected Results:**
- When not logged in, user is redirected to the login page
- After logging in, user can access the protected route

### 5. Responsive Design

**Test Steps:**
1. Open the login page in a desktop browser
2. Verify the layout looks correct
3. Resize the browser to tablet size (e.g., 768px width)
4. Verify the layout adjusts properly
5. Resize to mobile size (e.g., 375px width)
6. Verify the layout remains usable
