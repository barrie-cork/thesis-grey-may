# Feature Reorganization Summary

## Completed Reorganization Work

I've implemented the proposed reorganization plan for the Thesis Grey project, focusing on the three core features as prioritized:

### 1. Core Features Reorganization

#### `searchStrategy` Feature
- Created `/components/SearchSessionList.tsx` - Displays search sessions in a grid
- Created `/components/CreateSessionForm.tsx` - Form for creating new search sessions
- Created `/hooks/useSearchSessions.ts` - Hook for managing search session data and operations
- Updated `pages/SearchStrategyPage.tsx` to use the new components and hooks
- Added `/utils` directory for future utility functions

#### `resultsManager` Feature
- Created `/components/ResultsHeader.tsx` - Header displaying session info and navigation
- Created `/components/ResultProcessingSection.tsx` - Section for processing raw results
- Created `/components/ResultsList.tsx` - Component for displaying processed results
- Created `/components/FilterControls.tsx` - Controls for filtering and sorting results
- Created `/hooks/useResultsFiltering.ts` - Hook for filtering and sorting functionality
- Created `/hooks/useResultsProcessing.ts` - Hook for results processing operations
- Created `/types.ts` - Type definitions for the feature
- Updated `pages/ResultsManagerPage.tsx` to use the new components and hooks

#### `reviewResults` Feature
- Created `/components/TagsPanel.tsx` - Panel for managing and selecting tags
- Created `/components/ResultItem.tsx` - Component for displaying individual search results with tags
- Created `/components/ResultsPanel.tsx` - Panel for displaying search results with filtering
- Created `/components/Pagination.tsx` - Pagination component for navigating through results
- Created `/hooks/useResultReview.ts` - Hook for review functionality
- Created `/types.ts` - Type definitions for the feature
- Updated `pages/ReviewPage.tsx` to use the new components and hooks

### 2. Directory Structure Implementation

For each feature, I've established the standard directory structure:

```
feature/
├── pages/           # Page components that correspond to routes
├── components/      # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks for this feature
└── utils/           # Utility functions specific to this feature
```

## Remaining Work

The following features have been set up with the correct directory structure but may need further component extraction:

1. `auth` - Review for potential component extraction
2. `serpExecution` - Review for potential component extraction 
3. `reporting` - Review for potential component extraction

## Benefits of the New Structure

The reorganization provides several key benefits:

1. **Improved maintainability**: Components are now clearly separated by responsibility
2. **Better discoverability**: Developers can quickly find the right component by purpose
3. **Easier testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Simplified refactoring**: Changes to one component won't affect unrelated code
5. **Cleaner page components**: Page components now focus on composition rather than implementation details

## Next Steps

To complete the reorganization:

1. Review the remaining features to identify components that should be extracted
2. Extract components from the remaining features following the same pattern
3. Update any imports that may be affected by the reorganization
4. Add comprehensive tests for the extracted components

This reorganization has significantly improved the code structure while maintaining the benefits of the vertical slice architecture.
