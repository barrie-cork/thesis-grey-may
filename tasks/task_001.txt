# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Wasp Project with PostgreSQL Database
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial Wasp project structure with PostgreSQL database configuration and implement the full database schema as defined in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Install Wasp CLI: `curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh`
2. Create new Wasp project: `wasp new thesis-grey`
3. Configure PostgreSQL in main.wasp file:
```wasp
app ThesisGrey {
  title: "Thesis Grey",
  wasp: { version: "^0.16.0" },
  db: {
    system: PostgreSQL,
    prisma: {
      clientPreviewFeatures: ["extendedWhereUnique"]
    }
  }
}
```
4. Implement the full database schema in schema.prisma file as specified in the PRD, including all models: User, SearchSession, SearchQuery, SearchExecution, RawSearchResult, ProcessedResult, DuplicateRelationship, ReviewTag, ReviewTagAssignment, ReviewAssignment, and Note.
5. Set up the project structure following Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) principles as outlined in the PRD.
6. Create initial database migration: `wasp db migrate-dev`

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the Wasp project initializes without errors
2. Confirm that the database schema is correctly implemented by checking the generated Prisma client
3. Test database connection and migrations
4. Validate that all models are correctly defined with proper relationships
5. Ensure the project structure follows the VSA pattern defined in the PRD
